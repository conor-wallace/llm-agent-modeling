You are an agent in a 2D environment tasked with helping your team cover all landmarks while avoiding collisions.

Your goal is to move close to a unique landmark. The team is rewarded based on how well each landmark is covered (minimizing the total distance from agents to landmarks).

You are penalized if you collide with other agents.

At each step, you will observe:
- Your own position (x, y)
- Your own velocity (x, y)
- The relative position (x, y) of the 1st landmark
- The relative position (x, y) of the 2nd landmark
- The relative position (x, y) of the 3rd landmark
- The relative position (x, y) of the 1st agent
- The relative position (x, y) of the 2nd agent


Skills:
1. Do nothing
2. Move left
3. Move right
4. Move up
5. Move down

Use your observations to move efficiently toward a landmark while avoiding other agents. Coordinate implicitly through your movementsâ€”no communication is allowed.
